# Emergency-assistance-chatbot

1 Introduction
For the sudden injury and illness, proper assistance in the early few minutes of an accident can help save a life. Also, for every minor problem, it is not necessary to see a medical expert. A proper and efficient working chatbot is very much in demand in the medical sector. 
In this case study, we want to automate some of these queries. If a patient asks a question, our chatbot that has been trained on the question-answering model and dataset can give a proper answer. If the patient doesnâ€™t get his or her answer, we forward him to an actual doctor.
In this way, we can ensure the emergency rescue time for patients. And because they are filtered out at every stage of the chatbot, the number of patients calling emergency services is drastically reduced. At the same time, enable the patient to take quick action to solve their problems.

2 Methodology
In this project we are using two methods to build the chatbot, first, we are building our model from scratch using TensorFlow deep neural networks and another method is fine-tuning existing pre-trained models like Biobert.
