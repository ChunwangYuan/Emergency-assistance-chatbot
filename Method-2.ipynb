circumstances it is best to opt for abortion. otherwise you need to inform your parents about it. the best way to do is go for a dilatation and curettage. vacuum evacuation can be tried before 7 weeks of pregnancy. if you do not want that then you can try a drug which contains a chemical called mifepristone. the best method through pills is a combination of mifepristone plus prostaglandin. discuss this with the gynecologist. i would suggest you consult a gynecologist if your pregnancy test is positive and not go for any pills on your own as they carry the danger of incomplete abortion and very heavy bleeding. a dose higher than the required dose can cause damage to the uterus too. so please do not self medicate. after the termination think in terms of inserting iud or other such devices

by the emotional lability during pregnancy along with the feeling that your husband is not supportive and is emotionally and verbally abusing you. two main hormones estrogen and progesterone cause mood swings during pregnancy. emotions are always unstable and feeling of depression is normal as any other body changes during pregnancy. the third trimester is the most anxious one. this is the period when mother-to-be worries about everything and anything that she can think of. however her major cause of anxiety lies not just on the labour and delivery process but also in baby care and parenting in general. you might be feeling physically uncomfortable with the growth of the abdomen and may feel irritated with the lightest noise as you lack sleep in general. it may be more extreme if your partner is unresponsive to your special requirements during pregnancy as he may not realise that the mood swings are normal in pregnancy. however if the mood swings of anxiety sadness and anger continuously persist more than two weeks you must meet the practitioner. you may be suffering from depression that needs immediate care and attention called bipolar disorder. a survey states that untreated emotional health problems can affect your baby's physical well being and increase the risk of preterm labor and postpartum depression. get treated with the right psychotherapy and

enzymes required for digestion of food. in some patients removal of part of the pancreas during the whipple operation can lead to a diminished production of these enzymes. patients complain of bulky diarrhea type of stool that is very oily. long-term treatment with oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation usually provides relief from this problem. 2. alteration in diet: after the whipple operation

{'answer': \"you seem concerned about the stiffness in your 17 month old baby diagnosed with cerebral palsy. cerebral palsy hinders proper motor development due to which a child's movement and muscle coordination gets impaired. however there are a number of treatments that help a child overcome his disabilities. of all these physical therapy for cerebral palsy is of great help. a physical therapist is trained to improve muscle coordination and movement through exercise and other devices. positioning is done to reduce unwanted tone and to attain long stretches. for this purpose a number of devices like braces knee mobilisers pillows casts or splints may be used. the bobath treatment aims to improve posture and movement to enable more realistic functioning in daily life. through specialised ways of handling stiffness can be reduced muscle control against gravity increased and fluctuating muscle activity stabilised. depending on the severity of the condition the child may be better able to learn how to sit up use his/her hands to stand up to stand and to walk. ideally the treatment will be an integral part of the daily routine for that child. for example the way the child is picked up carried put down or positioned when sitting will enable parents/carers to enhance the child's ability and function. the aims of the treatment are goal-orientated and influenced by several factors such as the age of the child severity of their condition and their motivation. treatment is planned for each child via assessment. some of the areas that will be assessed are: â\\x80¢ the patterns of movement the child presents with; â\\x80¢ age-appropriate movements that the child may not be achieving or may find difficult; â\\x80¢ the child's present capabilities; â\\x80¢ examination of the child's posture in different situations and positions. once the child has been assessed a prioritized 'problem-solving' list will be formulated and then appropriate techniques used to address these areas. positioning is very important in bobath treatment. correct positioning helps improve movements. experience of different positions is necessary to improve overall body control and reduce the risk of unnecessary poor posture. handling a child using key points on the body allows the therapist to manipulate the child to correct their movements. help may be given with movements like chewing handling objects moving about sitting or lying down. even when a child is being carried using correct positioning and handling of 'key points' on the child's body is considered very important as this lets the child experience as far possible normal movement patterns. you may consult a physical therapist for more detailed assessment and the use of devices and machines. hope this helps. take

wrapped around the esophagus (gullet) - making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux. the complication rate is 15-60% resulting in patients not being able to 'burp' swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit. with a viral-like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself. it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10-30% of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years. however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth. with this new procedure - called 'endoscopic fundoplication'- there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope - through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required. the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic. most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay. following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport. anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks. the long-term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1-3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication. only 3 remain taking any medication. no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free. about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist; they are probably caused by his preexisting condition-cerebral palsy.\", 'question': 'my brother is 23 years old and has severe cerebral palsy for the last few years he has been complaining of stomach pains but was not able to explain what sort

pregnancy to occur two things are important: 1) firstly pregnancy occurs during the time of ovulation when a mature egg is released from the follicle. it usually occurs regularly around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. 2) secondly for pregnancy to occur the sperms need to be ejaculated inside the vagina or there should be entry of sperms inside the vagina which travel through the cervix and

information that you have given about your 4 year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school 4 out of 5 days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is

slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue

even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md

completely calm. my father is the same way i have constant anxiety and i'm almost never completely happy about something. my moods are all over the place but the most dominating and often reoccurring is anger i literally wake up in the morning angry for no reason. i was never like this before i hit about 14 i just turned 21 and it seems to be getting increasingly worse. it just feels like i'm someone else completely when it's happening an i just don't feel like i can stop no matter who i'm taking it out on then i snap out of it after it finally exhaust's me and it's just almost like it was a different person acting that way. i don't have the money to go to the doctor and i don't have insurance. i feel like i can't handle this emotional roller-coaster anymore. does this classify under bipolar and if so what type?\", 'url': 'http://ehealthforum.com/health/constantly-have-bursts-of-anger-for-no-reason-t277535.html', 'tags': ['bipolar disorder', 'anxiety', 'bipolar', 'angry', 'anxiety

that you might be having a mood disorder (bipolar disorder). but additional history and a face to face discussion is needed to know the exact problem. for a proper diagnosis and treatment you might

outbursts of anger. i first started this when i was in 1st grade where i would have 1-2 hour bursts of anger followed by a long fit of crying. i would completely freak out and start trying to injure myself start shouting resisting people trying to calm me etc. it would be quite frequent (at least once a week) and would continue up until the end of 6th grade where after 6th grade i thought it was gone for good. until i had an episode when i was a sophomore in high school when walking around with friends. it was the same as before punching a stone wall shouting incoherently the exact same type of thing. after that i usually have an episode about one time every year sometimes two. sometimes i'll also feel very depressed for about 1-2 hours as well with it just ending almost abruptly. i've always absolutely hated what this is and i want to have an idea of what is going on. thanks for reading.\", 'url': 'http://ehealthforum.com/health/almost-random-outbursts-of-anger-t291154.html',
